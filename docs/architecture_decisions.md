# ADR-001: Governance Architecture - Policy-as-Code with OPA

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-03-03  
**Deciders**: Aegis-OS Core Team

## Context

AI agents executing autonomous tasks need clearly defined, auditable permissions. Static API keys and hard-coded rules do not scale and cannot be changed without a code deployment.

## Decision

Use Open Policy Agent (OPA) with Rego policies as the Policy-as-Code engine for all agent access decisions. Policies live in `policies/` and are loaded into the OPA server at startup.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Policies can be updated independently of application code.  
- **Positive**: Every access decision is logged and auditable.  
- **Negative**: Adds an OPA server dependency; mitigated by the Docker Compose setup.

# ADR-002: Just-In-Time Agent Tokens

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-03-03

## Context

Long-lived API keys have a large blast radius if compromised.

## Decision

Issue short-lived (15-minute) JWT tokens scoped to a specific agent type and requester via `src/governance/session_mgr.py`. Tokens are signed with a secret stored in HashiCorp Vault.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Compromised tokens expire quickly.  
- **Positive**: Token scope limits lateral movement.  
- **Negative**: Agents must renew tokens; handled transparently by the Control Plane.

# ADR-003: Circuit Breaker for Agent Loop Detection

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-03-03

## Context

LLM agents can enter infinite loops, burning tokens and incurring unexpected costs.

## Decision

Implement a `LoopDetector` watchdog (`src/watchdog/loop_detector.py`) that raises a `LoopDetectedError` when an agent exceeds `MAX_AGENT_STEPS` without a `PROGRESS` signal or exceeds `MAX_TOKEN_VELOCITY`. This triggers a `Human_Intervention_Required` event in Temporal.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Hard cap on runaway agent costs.  
- **Positive**: Humans remain in the loop for stuck workflows.  
- **Negative**: Legitimate long-running tasks must emit progress signals; documented in the agent SDK guide.

# ADR-004: FastAPI as the Control Plane API Framework

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-03-03  
**Deciders**: Aegis-OS Core Team

## Context

Aegis-OS requires an HTTP API framework that supports async-native execution (for non-blocking OPA and LLM adapter calls), automatic OpenAPI documentation, and tight Pydantic integration for strict input validation at every trust boundary.

## Decision

Use FastAPI 0.115+ as the Control Plane API framework. All request/response models are defined as Pydantic `BaseModel` subclasses. All route handlers and adapter calls are `async def`.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Async-native; OPA evaluations and LLM calls do not block the event loop.
- **Positive**: Pydantic `BaseModel` enforces schema validation at every API boundary — unknown `agent_type` values are rejected before they reach governance logic.
- **Positive**: Auto-generated OpenAPI schema at `/docs` serves as living API documentation.
- **Negative**: FastAPI has no built-in rate limiting; requires `slowapi` or an upstream gateway (addressed in Phase 1).

# ADR-005: structlog + OpenTelemetry for Observability

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-03-03  
**Deciders**: Aegis-OS Core Team

## Context

Audit logging for an AI governance platform must be structured (machine-parseable), correlated (events for the same task must be linked), and extensible (new frameworks like SOC2 or GDPR should not require changes to the logging layer).

## Decision

Use `structlog` for structured JSON log emission and the OpenTelemetry SDK for distributed trace correlation. The `AuditLogger` class in `src/audit_vault/logger.py` wraps both. Security-relevant events use `AuditLogger.audit()`, which opens an OTel span and attaches `agent_id` and `action` as span attributes. All other events use `info()`, `warning()`, or `error()`.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Python stdlib `logging` + JSON formatter**: Lacks built-in context binding and processor chain; more boilerplate for structured output.
- **Loguru**: No native OTel integration; community-maintained rather than CNCF-backed.
- **Direct OTel Logs API**: Insufficient maturity for structured log output at the time of decision.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Every log entry is valid JSON, readable by any SIEM without a custom parser.
- **Positive**: OTel spans correlate audit events to distributed traces; compatible with Jaeger, Zipkin, and OTLP collectors.
- **Positive**: `structlog` processor chain is composable; adding PII scrubbing to all log output is a single processor addition.
- **Negative**: `ConsoleSpanExporter` is used in v0.1; must be replaced with an OTLP exporter before production (see `SECURITY.md`).

# ADR-006: Vendor-Agnostic BaseAdapter ABC for LLM Providers

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-03-03  
**Deciders**: Aegis-OS Core Team

## Context

Aegis-OS targets a multi-vendor LLM environment (OpenAI, Anthropic, Local Llama). Provider APIs differ in authentication, request/response schema, token counting, and error handling. The Aegis Governance Loop must apply identically regardless of which provider executes the prompt.

## Decision

Define a `BaseAdapter` abstract base class in `src/adapters/base.py` with a standardized `LLMRequest` / `LLMResponse` model pair. Every provider adapter implements `async def complete(request: LLMRequest) -> LLMResponse`. The Control Plane only operates on these standardized models; provider-specific details are encapsulated inside each adapter.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: The Guardrails, BudgetEnforcer, and AuditLogger are provider-agnostic; adding a new LLM provider requires only a new adapter class.
- **Positive**: Token count normalization (`LLMResponse.tokens_used`) ensures `BudgetEnforcer` works consistently across providers with different tokenization schemes.
- **Positive**: Enables the multi-vendor arbitrage routing planned in Phase 2/3 without changes to the governance layer.
- **Negative**: Lowest-common-denominator `LLMRequest` model may not expose provider-specific features (e.g., OpenAI function calling schema); adapters may need to extend the base model.

# ADR-007: pydantic-settings with AEGIS_ Prefix for Configuration

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-03-03  
**Deciders**: Aegis-OS Core Team

## Context

Aegis-OS must run in multiple environments (development, staging, production) without code changes. All tunable parameters — budget limits, token thresholds, service endpoints, signing keys — must be injectable from the environment in accordance with 12-factor App principles.

## Decision

Use `pydantic-settings` `BaseSettings` with `env_prefix="AEGIS_"` and `case_sensitive=False`. All configuration is centralized in `src/config.py` as a single `Settings` singleton. No module reads environment variables directly; all configuration is accessed via `from src.config import settings`.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: A single `settings` object is the contract for all tunable parameters; easy to mock in tests.
- **Positive**: `pydantic-settings` validates types and applies defaults at startup; misconfiguration fails fast with a clear error.
- **Positive**: The `AEGIS_` prefix avoids collisions with OS and framework environment variables.
- **Negative**: Secrets (signing key, Vault token) are currently loaded from environment variables; Phase 4 will replace these with dynamic Vault fetches so that secrets are never present in the process environment.

# ADR-008: In-Memory State for v0.1 with Explicit Temporal Migration Path

**Status**: Accepted (with expiry)  
**Date**: 2026-03-03  
**Deciders**: Aegis-OS Core Team  
**Expiry**: This decision is superseded by the Phase 2 Temporal integration.

## Context

`BudgetEnforcer` and `LoopDetector` maintain per-session state. In a production system this state must be durable (survive restarts), consistent across multiple API replicas, and recoverable after an LLM provider outage. Implementing durable state correctly from day one would require Temporal integration before any other module is testable.

## Decision

For v0.1, use in-memory Python dicts (`self._sessions`, `self._contexts`) with no persistence. Document this explicitly as a known limitation in `SECURITY.md` and `docs/threat-model.md`. Design the public API of both watchdog classes so that replacing the backing store (in Phase 2) requires no changes to callers.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: All watchdog logic is testable from day one without a running Temporal cluster.
- **Positive**: `AgentScheduler` and both watchdog classes already use the abstraction that Phase 2 will fill with real Temporal workflow state.
- **Negative**: A process restart loses all active session budgets and loop detection contexts. This is a **known, accepted risk** for development environments only.
- **Negative**: Running multiple `aegis-api` replicas in v0.1 results in split-brain budget tracking — each replica has its own in-memory state. Horizontal scaling is unsafe until Phase 2.
